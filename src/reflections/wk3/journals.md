>What is a benefit of using the Module System?
- increase performance
- easier debugging
- no naming conflicts

>What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
- subscribe, unsubscribe and broadcast

>Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

# Friday
>This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.
