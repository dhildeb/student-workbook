> What is Scope?
- scope is where variables are available, global variables hav a scope of the whole document, whereas variables inside of functions only have a scope within that function.


> What is Hoisting?
- Hoisting is a mechanism where variables are moved to the top of their scope, along with function declarations. 


> In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
- let is used anytime you want to make a variable that can be changed.
- const is used when you want to make a variable that is unchanged
- var is used if your coding before the year 2015, or dont know about let.

>What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
- function declaration, is hoisted
- function expression, is not hoisted
- arrow function expression, a shorthand for function expression

>What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
- parameters are names that have no value, made when writing functions
- arguments are the input from the user that goes into the function

>What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
- higher order functions are functions within functions (funception). 
const doubleFunct = function(x){
  x+x
}
const doubleCount = doublefunt

>What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
- console.log(), throw new error(), console.error(), 
- each is useful for debugging, you can throw an error message when input doesnt match up.

>Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
- elements tab, its useful to see exactly whats being applied to the element and how it looks to make adjustments.

>Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
- use the debugger and code editor

# Thursday

>What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
- planning can prevent the need to rewrite a lot of your code because you know the big picture and know whats functions you need and how they work together.

>How do you find answers when you are stuck?
- google it! there's a solution that you can find a lot faster than trying to figure it out yourself.

>From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
- Simplify code and most importantly make it readable! 
- Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.

# Friday
>This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.
