> What is Scope?
- scope is where variables are available, global variables hav a scope of the whole document, whereas variables inside of functions only have a scope within that function.


> What is Hoisting?
- Hoisting is a mechanism where variables are moved to the top of their scope, along with function declarations. 


> In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
- let is used anytime you want to make a variable that can be changed.
- const is used when you want to make a variable that is unchanged
- var is used if your coding before the year 2015, or dont know about let.

>What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
- function declaration, is hoisted
- function expression, is not hoisted
- arrow function expression, a shorthand for function expression

>What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
- parameters are names that have no value, made when writing functions
- arguments are the input from the user that goes into the function

>What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
- higher order functions are functions within functions (funception). 
const doubleFunct = function(x){
  x+x
}
const doubleCount = doublefunt
