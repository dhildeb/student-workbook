# What is the purpose of wire-framing?
> wire-framing a first step toward the developement processes
- by wire-framing you can simplify the coding process by dividing it into easy to understand sections
- by planning out the frame work you can increase productivity

# What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
> low-fidelity wireframes
- good for mapping out navigation and user flow. 
- useful for a quick example of concept.
>mid-fidelity wireframes
- used for more accurate representation of layout
- still rather simple and easy to put together while being more informative.
> high-fidelity wireframes
- detailed representation of the layout
- useful later in the developement process to show more details like color and sizing.

# Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
> I think each type of wireframing is worth doing depending on the situation. for beginning a project a rough sketch can help to visualize the concept and prevent wasted effort. the other wireframing i see being useful for sharing concepts and changing details before too much time is wasted designing an element that might be tossed.s
