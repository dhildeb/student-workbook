# Thursday
>What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
- Unit Testing, allows you to test individual units of code, does not differ largely from other tests.
- Component Testing, allows you to test components with several plug in options.
- End-To-End (E2E) Testing, allows for whole application testing, ability to view what the user would.

>What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
- Component Testing, i think it would be most useful to test seperate components rather than the whole application or smaller units.

>What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
- Unit Testing, testing as such a small level seems tedious and time consuming when you can do larger tests to cover more coding ground.
